# Water-level-classification-using-computer-vision
In this project, I participated in developing a computer vision-based system for classifying water based on its level. The primary objective was to create an automated solution that could accurately detect and measure water levels in water bottles.

Project Highlights:
1. Preprocessing: The captured images were preprocessed to enhance clarity and remove noise, ensuring accurate detection.
2. Water Level Detection: Using advanced computer vision techniques, we implemented custom CNN to detect the water level from the images. This involved edge detection, contour analysis, and region segmentation to precisely identify the waterline.
3. Measurement and Calibration: The detected water level was then calibrated against known reference points to provide accurate measurements. This step was crucial for translating pixel data into real-world units.

This project demonstrated the potential of computer vision in monitoring and provided hands-on experience in developing and deploying vision-based solutions for real-world applications.
